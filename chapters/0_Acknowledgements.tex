First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors, Prof. Dr. Jorge Cabral and Prof. Dr. Rainer Leupers, for the support and motivation that 
they gave during this journey.

Then, I would like to express my gratitude to Niko Zurstraßen. Niko was the first contact that I had when I arrived in Germany. He helped me 
not only in the development of this work but also in the adaptation to a new city and new people. Also, a special word for Rui Almeida and 
Rui Machado, who supported me all the time with their knowledge and expertise. Furthermore, and most importantly, thank you all for your 
friendship.

I want to acknowledge also my family and friends, especially José Carvalho, João Carneiro, and my girlfriend Anabela. 
They were crucial in this part of my life, not only backing me up but keeping me motivated and relaxed as well.

Lastly, I want to thank all the professors that I had since I started studying, for teaching me their knowledge and guiding me to achieve this 
goal. Just a special note to Prof. Mário Roque, and Prof. Rui Barreiro, who with their teaching and empathy guided me to 
choose the electrical engineering field, for which I am grateful.
